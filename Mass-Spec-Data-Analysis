# Proteomics Analysis Template (MaxQuant + R)

This repository contains a reproducible and modular RMarkdown pipeline for the statistical analysis and quality control of label-free proteomics data. It is designed to process proteinGroups output from **MaxQuant**, along with a corresponding sample list.

> ⚠ The template currently supports **two-condition datasets** and includes filtering, normalization, imputation, QC visualization, and coefficient of variation analysis.

##  Features
- Interactive file selection for proteins, sample list (and optionally peptides)
- Protein filtering based on peptide count and contaminants
- Median normalization and MNAR + MissForest imputation
- Multiple QC plots:
  - Quantified protein & peptide counts
  - Violin plots before/after normalization
  - Missing-value distributions and heatmaps
  - Coefficient of Variation (CV) across groups
  - Scatterplot matrix, 2D density plots, and more
- Export of all plots as PNG and SVG

##  Expected Input Files
- `*_Proteins.txt`: Protein groups file from MaxQuant
- `sample_list.txt`: A tab-delimited file with at least two columns:
  - `Sample` – new sample names
  - `RawFile` – matching names as in proteinGroups columns
  - `Group` – group/condition name
- *(Optional)* `*_PeptideGroups.txt` if peptide-level analysis is needed
