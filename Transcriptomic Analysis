Title:
Colorectal Cancer RNA-Seq Analysis using DESeq2

Description:
This R script performs differential gene expression analysis of colorectal cancer RNA-seq data using the DESeq2 pipeline. The workflow includes data import, quality control, normalization, statistical testing, and visualization of significantly regulated genes. The dataset consists of two experimental conditions (e.g., tumor vs. normal), and the results support downstream functional enrichment and biomarker discovery.

Key steps covered in the script:

Loading raw count matrix and sample metadata

DESeq2 normalization and dispersion estimation

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

MA and Volcano plots for visualizing results

Export of differentially expressed genes

Heatmap clustering of significant genes

Tools used:

DESeq2

ggplot2

pheatmap
